Snake-esque game, but dialed after the food chain
Start out as a small animal, go around eating plants and staying away from predators
Once you eat enough food, you get sent to a menu and you can choose one of your predators to turn into (at a limited level, e.g. can't go from a rabbit to a mountain lion)
win when you get to an apex predator
if you hit an animal above your level that isnt a direct predator you go down a level
if you hit an animal at your level you go back to 0 xp
if you hit a direct predator you die
